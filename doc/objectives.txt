the goal is to construct forms directly from doctrine's entities's metadatas.
Symfony achieve it so well, form has to become symplier and simplier to generate with use of entities
At that time, it remains too much verbose

1/ the annotation builder builds form specifications that are given to the form factory who builds the final form.

this tool has then as main goal to allow to get form specifications based on doctrine's entitie's metadatas
those specifications could then be merged with some generated with annotations to remain consistent 

finally, things are simple :
	we are going top map doctrine fields properties to form's element's properties and attributes

they will be dependencies for this module:
	- doctrine-commons (annotations)
	- doctrine-orm (entity manager)
